# 📚 Week 2: Operators, Conditions & Basic C Programs

This week focuses on understanding and applying **C operators**, **arithmetic calculations**, and **conditional statements**. The goal is to strengthen core programming skills by writing simple, functional programs that demonstrate logic and structure.

## ✅ Concepts Learned
- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Relational and Logical Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Variable swapping and user input handling

## 🧠 Programs Included
- 🔄 Swap two numbers using a temporary variable
- ➕ Sum of two numbers
- 🌡️ Temperature conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- ✅ Condition-based output (like checking if a number is positive or negative)

Each program is beginner-friendly and includes clear comments to explain how it works. This week builds the foundation for more complex decision-making and data handling in future lessons.
