# 📚 Week 4: Functions, Types of Functions & Recursion in C

Welcome to **Week 4** of our C Programming journey! 🔍  
This week, we explored one of the most powerful features in programming — **functions**. We learned how to create and use our own functions, explored different **types of functions**, and understood the concept of **recursion**, where a function calls itself!

These concepts help us break complex problems into smaller, reusable parts — the heart of modular and clean code design. 🧩

## ✅ Concepts Covered

🔧 **Functions in C**  
Functions allow us to structure our code better and reduce repetition. We covered:
- **Function declaration, definition, and calling**
- **Return types and parameters**
- **Benefits of using functions**: readability, reusability, and debugging ease

🧠 **Types of Functions**
1. Function with no return and no parameters  
2. Function with return but no parameters  
3. Function with parameters but no return  
4. Function with return and parameters

🔁 **Recursion**  
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. We explored:
- How recursion works (with base and recursive cases)
- Stack memory behavior
- Real-life examples like factorial and Fibonacci series

## 🧠 Programs Implemented

| Program | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧮 Add Two Numbers | Using user-defined function to add values. |
| 🔁 Factorial (Recursion) | Calculate factorial of a number using recursion. |
| 🧵 Fibonacci Series | Print Fibonacci numbers using recursion. |
| 📤 Find Max Number | Function with parameters and return value. |
| 🔄 Even/Odd Check | Function with no return, with parameters. |
| 🧩 Modularized Pattern Printer | Pattern generation using custom functions. |

Each code file includes:
- Proper function prototypes
- Explanations via comments
- Examples of all function types
- Recursive problem solving

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Functions make code more **modular**, **organized**, and **debuggable**.
- Recursion is a great tool for solving problems that can be divided into similar subproblems.
- Understanding base and recursive cases is critical to avoid infinite recursion.
- Memory usage is different in recursion due to the function call stack.

## 🔍 Extra Practice (Optional)

We also tried solving a few extra questions like:
- Recursive sum of digits
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) using recursion
- Prime number checker using function

Try to write these on your own to reinforce your understanding! 💪

## 📘 What’s Coming Next?

In **Week 5**, we'll dive into **Arrays** — how to store multiple values, access them using indices, and process them efficiently. Get ready to work with data collections! 📊
