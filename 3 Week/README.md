# 📚 Week 3: Mastering Loops, Nested Loops & Switch Statements in C

Welcome to **Week 3** of our C programming journey! 🚀  
This week, we delved into one of the most important programming concepts: **Control Flow**. We explored how to **repeat tasks using loops**, how to **build patterns using nested loops**, and how to **make multiple decisions using the `switch` statement**.

These concepts are essential for writing efficient, flexible, and scalable programs.

## ✅ Concepts Covered

🔄 **Loops**  
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly:
- `for` loop – Best for known iterations.
- `while` loop – Runs as long as a condition is true.
- `do-while` loop – Runs at least once, checks condition later.

🔁 **Nested Loops**  
A loop inside another loop. Used to:
- Print patterns like triangles or grids.
- Process 2D arrays or matrix-style data.

🧭 **Switch Case**  
An alternative to multiple `if-else` statements:
- Ideal for menu-driven programs.
- Clean and readable structure for multiple options.

⛔ **Break & Continue**
- `break` – Exits the loop or switch immediately.
- `continue` – Skips current iteration and moves to the next.

## 🧠 Programs Implemented

Here’s what we practiced this week:

| Program | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔁 Number Printer | Print numbers using `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. |
| 🔢 Multiplication Table | Display the multiplication table of a given number. |
| 🌟 Star Pattern | Print pyramid and other patterns using nested loops. |
| 📋 Menu-Driven App | A `switch-case` based menu to perform basic operations. |
| 🔣 Vowel Checker | Check if a character is a vowel or consonant using `switch`. |
| 🛑 Loop Control | Demonstrate `break` and `continue` in loops. |

All programs are beginner-friendly with **clear comments** to help understand the logic line-by-line.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Loops help reduce code repetition.
- Nested loops are powerful for grid-based logic and patterns.
- `switch` makes your decision-making code cleaner.
- `break` and `continue` give more control over loop flow.

## 🔍 What's Next?

Next week, we'll move into **arrays** and start learning how to **store and manipulate collections of data**. Stay tuned for even more fun with C programming! 🎉
