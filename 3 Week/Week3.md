📚 Week 3: Loops, Nested Loops & Switch Statement
This week focuses on understanding how to repeat actions using loops, use nested loops for patterns or multi-level logic, and apply switch statements for multiple choice conditions. These are essential tools in controlling the flow of a program.

✅ Concepts Learned

for, while, and do-while loops

Nested loops (loop inside a loop)

switch statements for multi-way branching

Use of break and continue in loops

Pattern printing and iteration control

🧠 Programs Included
🔁 Print numbers using for, while, and do-while loops
🔂 Multiplication table using loops
📐 Star pattern printing using nested loops
📅 Menu-driven program using switch
🔣 Vowel or consonant checker using switch-case
🔁 Loop examples using break and continue

Each program is beginner-friendly and includes clear comments for easy understanding. This week builds the core understanding of how to repeat tasks and handle multiple conditions efficiently.
